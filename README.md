# Earth2-iOS

Unofficial E2 app client for iOS, built for fun (never released).

This project involved creating a custom Python web scraper (DJango) of https://earth2.io/, allowing a user to login, list all the tiles they owned, and feed all the public info back to the iOS app using a custom API.

The most fun part of this project was building the launchscreen, with a custom dynamic constellation drawer to be used for the background. Just gorgeous. The lauchscreen looked different every time the app would be lauched :)

### Screenshots of the app:
