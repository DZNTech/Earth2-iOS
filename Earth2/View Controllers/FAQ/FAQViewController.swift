This is typically called \"web scraping\" and is a read-only task. For this reason, features in this app are limited to what is visible on the website. You should know that \"web scraping\" is fragile and if the E2 developers changed things on the website, this app may malfunction.")]

No information is being tracked, stored nor logged in the server. \(StringConstants.credentialSavingDisc). You can disable this feature from within the application settings.")]

We will open source this application's source code on Github in order to give full transparency on how things work internally. This will be particularly useful if you are familiar with Apple's Swift programming and want to contribute to improve this app.")]
